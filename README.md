## GNOME theme for Firefox

(This is the theme previously known as "Adwaita".)

An easy-to-install version of this theme is available at 
[Mozilla's ADD-ONS site](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adwaita).

We recommend [HTitle](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/htitle) 
for the full GNOME 3 experience.

For current issues please see the 
[bug tracker](https://github.com/adwaita-firefox-team/adwaita-firefox/issues).

Help & feedback are both appreciated! ;-)
