## GNOME 3 Adwaita theme for Firefox

An easy-to-install version of this theme is available at:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adwaita/

We recommend [htitle](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/htitle) for the full GNOME 3 experience.

For current issues see:
https://github.com/adwaita-firefox-team/adwaita-firefox/issues

Help & feedback are both appreciated! ;-)
